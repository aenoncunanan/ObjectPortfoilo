###Introduction

- Today, I learned that Java Language is being used in Obejct Oriented Programming.
- I also learned that everything in java are objects.
- I've learned that Java language and C language has almost the same syntax.
- I've learned the differences between Java and C:
  - C Language is faster and more efficient because it is machine dependent, meaning, it can communicate with the machine directly.
- Class and Object were also introduced during the session using the house as an example.
- Class is the blueprint of the house, and the object is the actual thing, the house.
