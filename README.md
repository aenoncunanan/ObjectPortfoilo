#SESSION 0 (Wednesday, February 3, 2016):
###Introduction

- Today, I learned that Java Language is being used in Obejct Oriented Programming.
- I also learned that everything in java are objects.
- I've learned that Java language and C language has almost the same syntax.
- I've learned the differences between Java and C:
  - C Language is faster and more efficient because it is machine dependent, meaning, it can communicate with the machine directly.
  - C Language needs to be recompiled to run in another operating system (OS).
  - Java Language cannot communicate with the machine directly and it needs Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to be able to communicate with the machine.
  - Java is portable, meaning, it can be run in different operating systems (OS). The only requirement is that, the machine should have an installed JVM in it.
- Class and Object were also introduced during the session using the house as an example.
- Class is the blueprint of the house, and the object is the actual thing, the house.
