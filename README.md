#SESSION 0 (Wednesday, February 3, 2016):
###Introduction

- Today, I learned that Java Language is being used in Obejct Oriented Programming.
- I also learned that everything in java are objects.
- I've learned that Java language and C language has almost the same syntax.
- I've learned the differences between Java and C:
  - C Language is faster and more efficient because it is machine dependent, meaning, it can communicate with the machine directly.
  - C Language needs to be recompiled to run in another operating system (OS).
  - Java Language cannot communicate with the machine directly and it needs Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to be able to communicate with the machine.
  - Java is portable, meaning, it can be run in different operating systems (OS). The only requirement is that, the machine should have an installed JVM in it.
- Class and Object were also introduced during the session using the house as an example.
- Class is the blueprint of the house, and the object is the actual thing, the house.
- Public and Private Classes were also discussed:
  - Public Classes can be accessed by other classes while Private Classes is only accessible by a certain Class.
  - Using the Univeristy Building as an example, University Building, classrooms are declraed as private, meaning, only authorized people can access it, while comfort rooms are declared as public, where visitors can access it.
- Basic commands in linux terminal were also explained.
  - ` $ ls ` will list all the files and folders in the directory.
  - ` $ mkdir ` will create a new directory.
  - ` $ cd ` changes directory path
  - ` $ rm ` to erase or remove a file or folder.
  - By pressing the `ctrl+p` on your keyboard, the previous syntax, will be generated automatically.
  - By pressing the `ctrl+c`  or `ctrl+z`, the current process will be terminated.
  - By pressing the `Tab Key` on your keyboard, the syntax you are typing in will be auto completed.
  - ` $ mv ` to move a file.
  - ` $ pwd ` to check if directory exists.
  - ` $ clear ` will clear the terminal.
  - ` $ sudo apt-get install program ` will install a desired program.
  - ` $ javac ` to compile the source code.
  - ` $ java ` to run the source code.
- A [HelloWorld](https://github.com/aenoncunanan/HelloWorld) Java program was also made during this session.


#SESSION 1 (Wednesday, February 3, 2016):
###Introduction

- Having the basic knowledge in Java, I was able to create a [TruthTable](https://github.com/aenoncunanan/BooleanTable).


#SESSION 2 (Wednesday, February 10, 2016):
###Primitives

- In this session, primitives were discussed.
- Primitive data types are byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, and char.
- You can modify the user's input like making the characters in an upper case or a lower case.
- Boolean data types can accept only true or false, not 1 or 0.
- Date can also be placed using the Date utility of Java.
- By importing the java.io class from java, you will be able to get inputs from the user.
- Parsing can convert one data type to another data type.
- Exercises [Characters](https://github.com/aenoncunanan/Characters), [SimpleCalculator](https://github.com/aenoncunanan/SimpleCalc), and [StringOutput](https://github.com/aenoncunanan/StringOutput) were made during this session.


#SESSION 3 (Friday, February 12, 2016):
###SynatxAndFlow

- In this session, Syntax and Flow were discussed.
- [If-else statements](https://github.com/aenoncunanan/Conditional) were used in primitives and complex data types.
- When comparing primitive data types, equal sign, less than sign, and greater than sign can be used
- `.equals("");` syntax should be used in comparing complex data types.
- In Java, you can use strings, enumeration and integers in [switch cases](https://github.com/aenoncunanan/Switch).
- There are four (4) types of [loops](https://github.com/aenoncunanan/Loops) that can be used in java:
  - The conventional For-Loop:
    - ` for (condition){statement} `
  - The Each-For-Loop:
    - ` for(:){statement} `
  - The While-Loop:
    - ` While (condition){statement} `
  - The Do-While-Loop:
    - ` Do {statement} While (condition); `
- [Methods](https://github.com/aenoncunanan/Methods) were also discussed in this session, methods are like functions in C where you can also [pass an argument](https://github.com/aenoncunanan/MethodsWithArgs).
