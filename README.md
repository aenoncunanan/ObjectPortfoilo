###Introduction

- Today, I learned that Java Language is being used in Obejct Oriented Programming.
- I also learned that everything in java are objects.
- I've learned that Java language and C language has almost the same syntax.
- I've learned the differences between Java and C:
  1. C Language is faster and more efficient because it is machine dependent, meaning, it can communicate with the machine directly.
  2. C Language needs to be recompiled to run in another operating system (OS).
  3. Java Language cannot communicate with the machine directly and it needs Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to be able to communicate with the machine.
  4. Java is portable, meaning, it can be run in different operating systems (OS). The only requirement is that, the machine should have an installed JVM in it.
